# A sample Guardfile
# More info at https://github.com/guard/guard#readme

guard 'livereload', notify: false do
  watch(%r{index.html})
  watch(%r{css/.+\.css})
  watch(%r{js/.+\.js})
end

# P.S. I'm sorry, but Guard's documentation is really unfriendly for beginners.
# Maybe 'guard init livereload' is a good start for a Rails app, but it ends up
# being mostly useless for any other kind of project.
