The primary goal of the project is to create a web-based bioinformatics analysis tool for investigating interactions between human and viral DNA sequences and proteins.

As such, it has the potential to directly benefit research into the genetic origins of a certain class of diseases by illuminating the role of viral DNA/protein interactions with disease-associated regions of the genome.

In the design of the analysis tool, we intend to produce a modular application framework, designed in such a way as to facilitate code re-use, addressing a more general class of problem: quickly adding a web interface on top of an existing bioinformatics analysis pipeline.
